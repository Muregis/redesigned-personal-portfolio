3. **Copy PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md** and rename it to `README.md` in your project folder

4. **Fill in the template** with your project details

## 💡 Quick Tips

**Starting is the hardest part:**
- Don't wait for the "perfect" project
- A simple, well-documented project > complex, poorly explained one
- You can always improve it later

**Good first projects:**

- Personal website (HTML/CSS)
- Todo list app
- Simple database schema with queries
- Any school assignment you're proud of

## 📞 When Adding Projects

**Use the PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md for every project!**

It helps you document:

- What you learned
- Future improvements

- [ ] Portfolio looks professional
- [ ] You have 3+ documented projects

## 🚀 Next Immediate Step

**Right now, think about:**
- What's the simplest working project you have?
- Can you add it this week?
- Do you have screenshots or can you take some?

**Then just do it!** Start with one project, even if it's basic.
